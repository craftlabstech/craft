# Vercel Prisma Build Fix

## Problem

The application was failing to deploy on Vercel with the error:

```
Error [PrismaClientInitializationError]: Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies. This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered.
```

## Root Cause

Vercel caches dependencies, including the Prisma Client, which means the auto-generation of Prisma Client wasn't happening during the build process. This results in an outdated client that doesn't match the current schema.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated package.json scripts

- **Modified build script**: Changed from `"build": "next build"` to `"build": "prisma generate && next build"`
- **Added postinstall script**: Added `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to ensure Prisma Client is generated after dependencies are installed

### 2. Created vercel.json configuration

Added a `vercel.json` file with:

- Explicit `buildCommand` that includes `prisma generate`
- API function timeout configuration for database operations
- Environment variable `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY=true` for optimal Vercel deployment

### 3. Build Process Flow

1. `npm install` runs on Vercel
2. `postinstall` script automatically runs `prisma generate`
3. `build` command runs `prisma generate` again (as a safety measure) followed by `next build`
4. This ensures the Prisma Client is always up-to-date with the schema

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Updated build and added postinstall scripts
- `vercel.json` - Created new configuration file

## Verification

The build process has been tested locally and works correctly:

- Prisma Client generates successfully
- Next.js build completes without errors
- All routes and API endpoints are properly built

## Deployment

When you next deploy to Vercel, the build should complete successfully without the Prisma initialization error.

## Additional Notes

- The `postinstall` script ensures compatibility with fresh installs
- The explicit `prisma generate` in the build command provides redundancy
- The `vercel.json` configuration optimizes the deployment for Prisma usage
